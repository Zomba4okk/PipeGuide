File **show_lib_methods.py** contains functions, demonstrating input, output and description of some library methods. Run file and all information will be displayed in the console.

Some different ways to implement algorithm with and without **Pipe** are represented in file **pipe_vs_classical_python.py**. You can make sure that all methods are equal and get information about their work time by running file.

There are also presentations about Pipe library in 2 different formats (for Windows and Ubuntu).
